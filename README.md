# AlbumCollage #
# Description #
This is a simple web application made to build collages out of album cover images.
The album cover images are standardized and are found within the web application taking a user query, using the [MusicBrainz API](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_API "MusicBrainz API").
For now, a screenshot of the collage must be taken to download the collage, but a downloading feature is being developed.

- Collage dimensions edition (limited by viewport size).
